# Steganography-project
Overview:

This project demonstrates a simple yet effective method of hiding secret messages within images using steganography. It ensures secure communication by embedding data in an image without noticeable distortion. A passcode-based decryption system adds an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized access.

Features:


 1.Hide secret messages within images using pixel manipulation.
 
 2.Passcode protection for secure decryption.
 
 3.Lightweight and fast processing with minimal image distortion.
 
 4.Works on multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS).
 
 5.Uses OpenCV for image handling and manipulation.
